about me
===============

I belive that building and delivering higher quality software can be easier. Over the past 13 years
I've worked towards this goal.

In 2002, I completed a Master's of Mathematics with the Software Architecture Group at the University of Waterloo.
During this time I studied the different patterns of abstraction we use while building mental models of large 
software systems. Our team built tools and extracted the concrete architecture of several open source systems, including
the Linux Kernal, Mozilla Web Browser, Pine Mail Reader and many more.

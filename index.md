bio
===============
I belive that building and delivering higher quality software can be easier. Over the past 13 years
I've worked towards this goal.

I am an Eclipse committer and the Principal Architect for Yoxos Enterprise. I co-lead the Eclipse 
p2 project, serve on the Eclipse RT PMC, the Eclipse Planning Council and the Eclipse Architecture Council. 
I am also the Program Chair for EclipseCon 2014.
My interests include software architecture, component oriented design, release engineering, software
delivery and human-computer interaction.
I hold a Bachelor and Master's degree from the University of Waterloo and a PhD from the University of Victoria.


education
==============
1995 - 2000: 

2000 - 2002:  Master's of Mathematics, University of Waterloo.
I studied the different patterns of abstraction we use while building mental models of large 
software systems. Our team built tools and extracted the concrete architecture of several open source systems, including
the Linux Kernal, Mozilla Web Browser, Pine Mail Reader and many more.

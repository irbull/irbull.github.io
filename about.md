bio
===============
---------
I am an Eclipse committer and the Principal Architect for Yoxos Enterprise at EclipseSource. I co-lead the Eclipse 
p2 project, serve on the Eclipse RT PMC, the [Eclipse Planning Council](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Planning_Council) 
and the [Eclipse Architecture Council](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Architecture_Council). 
I'm also the Program Chair for [EclipseCon 2014](https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2014/).
My interests include software architecture, component oriented design, release engineering, software
delivery and human-computer interaction.
I hold a Bachelor and Master's degree from the University of Waterloo and a PhD from the University of Victoria.


open source

I work on several open source projects and serve on several councils / management committees around eclipse.org. 
I conduct training sessions, I've spoken at several conferences and I actively write about open source software 
on my [blog](http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/author/irbull/).

Here is a collection of some open source projects Iâ€™ve led:

[**Eclipse provisioning platform (p2)**](http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2)  
The p2 project is a sub-project of Equinox that focuses on provisioning technology for OSGi-based applications. Although p2 has specific support for installing Eclipse and Equinox-based applications, it includes a general-purpose provisioning infrastructure that can be used as the basis for provisioning solutions for a wide variety of software applications. ([more](http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2))

[**Plug-in Dependency Visualization Tool**](http://www.eclipse.org/pde/incubator/dependency-visualization/index.php)  
Understanding the transitive dependencies between your plug-ins (OSGi bundles) can be tricky. This tool, built on Zest, presents you with an interactive graph of all the dependencies in your system. ([more](http://www.eclipse.org/pde/incubator/dependency-visualization/index.php))


[**Zest: the Visualization toolkit for Eclipse**](http://eclipse.org/gef/zest/)  
I feel that creating interactive visualizations should not be any harder than creating other rich user interfaces. In particular, the API should not get in your way. I built Zest during my PhD to give software developers the ability to create highly interactive, graph based, visualizations using the same API as the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT). ([more](http://eclipse.org/gef/zest/))

employment
===============
---------
**2008 - present: EclipseSource**  
EclipseSource product representative, Principal Architect for Yoxos Enterprise and Eclipse Committer. 

**2009: Google Summer of Code, Mentor**  
Mentored several Eclipse.org students including the [Dot4Zest project](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Zest/DOT).

**2007: Google Summer of Code**  
Built and delivered the Eclipse [Plug-in Dependency Visualization tool](http://www.eclipse.org/pde/incubator/dependency-visualization/index.php).

**2002 - 2008: IBM Centers for Advanced Studies, Toronto ON**  
During my PhD studies, I spent the summers at IBM CAS working with several technical teams including the EMF and PDE teams.

**2000: Trilogy Software, Austin TX**  
Developer on the automotive configuration management team.

education
==============
---------
**2003 - 2008: PhD, Computer Science, University of Victoria**  
I studied the way we make sense of complex data through the use of information visualization.
In particular, I looked at how visualizations can be modeled and auto-generated from 
rich data sources. I applied my techniques to several areas, including the domain of program comprehension.

**2000 - 2002:  Master's of Mathematics, University of Waterloo**   
I studied the different patterns of abstraction we use while building mental models of large 
software systems. Our team built tools and extracted the concrete architecture of several open source systems, including
the Linux Kernal, Mozilla Web Browser, Pine Mail Reader and many more. |[pdf](docs/bull_thesis.pdf)|

**1995 - 2000: Bachelor of Mathematics, Honours Computer Science, Software Engineering Option**  
I completed an Honours Computer Science degree with advanced courses in Real-Time Operating Systems,
Computer Graphics and Compiler Construction.
